# PURE_analyses

This repository contains SAS programs developed for the analysis of the PURE dataset. The programs are written using a **procedural programming** approach, combining `DATA` and `PROC` steps in a modular and sequential manner. The goal is to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and logical flow in data processing and statistical analysis.

## Programming Approach
All programs are written in **procedural SAS**, combining `DATA` and `PROC` steps to perform:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Merging and reshaping of datasets
- Descriptive statistics
- Statistical modeling and reporting

This approach ensures step-wise traceability of the analysis pipeline.

## Important Notes for Users

Before running the scripts, please:

- Review the code **carefully** to ensure it matches your data structure and environment.
- Expect that **some programs may need debugging or modification**, depending on SAS version or local dataset differences.
- Check SAS **log files** for warnings or errors after each run.
- If you identify any issues or bugs, please **log them under the Issues tab** or fix and submit a pull request.
